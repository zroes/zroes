### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name's Zack, I'm a full stack developer (in training at Codeworks) and I enjoy applying myself and finding solution to difficult problems.

I primarily work with Vue, Bootstrap, and Node, with previous experience in Python and C++. I look forward to furthering my knowledge with new technologies!

When I'm not coding, I like to spend my time rock climbing at the gym, or backpacking in the great outdoors!
